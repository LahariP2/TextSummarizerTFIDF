Have you experienced this before? Who is right and who is wrong? Neither. 
It was at that point their biggest breakthrough came. Perhaps all those years 
of perseverance finally paid off. It must come from within you. Where are you 
settling in your life right now? Could you be you playing for bigger stakes than 
you are? So become intentional on 
what you want out of life. Commit to it. Nurture your dreams.
